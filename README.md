# play-timer
Here is a relatively simple Meteor program that can keep track of computer time.

It keeps track of a user's time through a timer that is saved on one tab.

It also presents all of its records on the homepage with limiters for user, date, and type of computer activty.

A nice little tool for limiting your kid's computer time :)
